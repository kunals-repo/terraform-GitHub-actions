**🚀 Azure Storage Deployment using Terraform & GitHub Actions (Self-Hosted Runner)**


**📌 Project Overview**
This project demonstrates an end-to-end CI/CD pipeline to deploy Azure infrastructure using Terraform integrated with GitHub Actions.

We deployed 3 Azure Storage Accounts automatically by triggering a pipeline when changes are pushed to the main.tf terraform file.
The pipeline runs on a self-hosted runner, providing better control, security, and execution within our own environment.

**🧰 Tools & Technologies Used**
Git – Version control system
GitHub – Repository and CI/CD pipeline management
Terraform – Infrastructure as Code (IaC) for Azure resources
GitHub Actions – Automation for CI/CD workflows
Microsoft Azure – Cloud platform
Self-Hosted Runner – Custom runner to execute pipeline jobs


**⚙️ CI/CD Pipeline Workflow**
Writes terraform code main.tf and variables.tf
Code is pushed to the GitHub repository
GitHub Actions pipeline is triggered automatically
Pipeline runs on a self-hosted runner
Workflow executes the following steps:
Checkout source code
Setup Terraform environment
Authenticate with Azure
Run terraform init
Run terraform plan
Run terraform apply
Azure resources (3 Storage Accounts) are created


**✅ Advantages of This Approach**

🔹 Automation
Fully automated infrastructure deployment
No manual intervention required

🔹 Security
Self-hosted runner runs inside controlled environment
Secure access to Azure resources

🔹 Consistency
Same infrastructure setup every time
Eliminates configuration drift

🔹 Version Control
Infrastructure changes tracked using Git
Easy rollback and audit

🔹 Scalability
Easily extendable to multiple environments (Dev, Test, Prod)

🔹 Flexibility
Custom runner configuration
Control over tools, dependencies, and execution

🧠 Key Learnings
Integration of Terraform with GitHub Actions
Setting up and using a self-hosted runner
Automating Azure deployments using CI/CD
Managing infrastructure using Infrastructure as Code
